    <h1>Responsive Redesign Assignment</h1>
    <p>The goal of this assignment was to practice redesigning a simple website.
      I was tasked with choosing an existing interface, analyzing and identifying flaws in the interface,
      creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for three screen sizes, and building a responsive website
      based on those prototypes.
    </p>
    <h2>Website</h2>
    <p>I chose to redesign a website for a restuarant called Luna De Xelajú. This is one of my favorite restuarants
      in my hometown. Although I had never explored their website before, I quickly identified multiple areas where
      improvements could be made. By enhancing their current website, Luna De Xelajú can effectively showcase their
      delicious food to attract new customers.
    </p>
    <p> Problems I found:
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li>It is difficult to see the photo behind their logo and information on the landing page</li>
        <li>Their landing page has text in Spanish</li>
        <li>Their address is not correctly spelled</li>
        <li>There are no links to their Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram pages even though they include the icons</li>
        <li>When you click on the Menu tab, you are taken to a different page where you don't
        immediately see the entire menu, it looks more like an ordering page</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> After putting their website into WebAIM WAVE, I found that the landing page reports zero errors and
      zero contrast errors. There are 37 aria labels and after reading them, I think some of the
      labels can be reworded for a more accurate description of the text and images on the site.
